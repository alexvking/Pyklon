Pyklon: Full-Featured Klondike Solitaire in Python
--------------------------------------------------
By Alex King

SUMMARY
-------
Pyklon is a full-featured Klondike Solitaire engine written in Python. It is 
completely playable (and kind of fun!) in the terminal, but was designed as a 
backend that could easily power a frontend UI.

Pyklon features endgame detection (solved games and unsolvable games).

USAGE
-----

Run <code>python main.py</code> at the terminal to play.

KNOWN ISSUES AND PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------------------

Right now, Pyklon does not store any statistics about played games. A future 
update could track wins, losses, and the best time to finish.
